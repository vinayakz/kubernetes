# ImagePullBackOff

An "ImagePullBackOff" error in Kubernetes means that your Pod failed to pull the container image from the registry. Kubernetes tried pulling the image multiple times but failed, so it backed off and stopped retrying for a while.

## Error -> Pulling a Container image
1. Invalid image or non existent image
2. Private secure (ImagePullSecretes) permission denied

# Back-off delay
The "back-off delay" is the waiting period Kubernetes uses before retrying an operation (like pulling an image) after it fails. It’s an exponential backoff algorithm, which means Kubernetes waits a bit longer after each failure before trying again.


## How Backoff Delay Works in Kubernetes
When a Pod starts and Kubernetes needs to pull an image:
1. It tries to pull the image from the registry.
2. If it fails, it schedules another attempt after a short delay (backoff delay).
3. If it fails again, the delay increases (exponentially) before the next attempt.
4. This continues until it hits a maximum backoff delay (default is 5 minutes).
5. After hitting the maximum delay, Kubernetes will keep retrying every max-delay interval until the Pod succeeds or is deleted.

### Example of Exponential Backoff in ImagePull

| Attempt  | Delay Before Next Try |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1st failure  | ~10 seconds  |
| 2nd failure  | ~20 seconds  |
| 3rd failure  | ~40 seconds  |

### Why Kubernetes Uses Backoff
- Prevents flooding the registry with requests (avoids rate-limiting issues).
- Reduces load on the node and network if something is wrong (bad image, wrong creds).
- Gives time for external problems to resolve (registry downtime, network issue).

### What Happens in the Background
- The kubelet (node agent) is responsible for pulling images.
- It logs events like Back-off pulling image "myimage:tag".
- Kubernetes stores backoff state per pod container.
- Once the container is successfully pulled, the backoff timer resets.

### How to Check Backoff in Real Time
```sh
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

### Resetting Backoff 
You can reset the backoff timer by:
- Deleting the Pod → new Pod starts fresh with no backoff delay.
- Or manually editing/restarting the Deployment.
